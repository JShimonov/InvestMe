# InvestMe

Wouldn't it be cool if you were notified when a model on a stock reaches a certain point notifying the user the ideal time to start buying or selling. This application is meant to focus specifically on that. It's amazing to make an algorithmic trading bot that can do this (which is in the works right now), it would also be cool to be notified when all of these events in the stock market occur.

As I progress in learning about various trading algorithms, for now, I will focus on creating simple trading algorithms for my bot to carry out

# Inputs

Since I have been making a ton of discord bots recently, I feel like this a great place to start. This would include:
[ ] Tracking stocks to watch
[ ] Notifying users of prices when a golden/death cross takes place
